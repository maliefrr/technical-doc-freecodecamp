                    Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 
                    Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very 
                    attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to 
                    connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and 
                    therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages 
                    program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available 
                    in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

                    Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. 
                    Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging 
                    Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, 
                    when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch 
                    the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of 
                    local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping 
                    through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, 
                    testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug 
                    a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes 
                    this simple approach very effective.

                    Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers 
                    to program without boilerplate (prepared) code. The simplest directive in Python is the "print" 
                    directive - it simply prints out a line (and also includes a newline, unlike in C).

                    There are two major Python versions, Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2 and 3 are quite 
                    different. This tutorial uses Python 3, because it more semantically correct and supports 
                    newer features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, one difference between Python 2 and 3 is the print statement. 
                    In Python 2, the "print" statement is not a function, and therefore it is invoked without 
                    parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function, and must be invoked with parentheses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To print a string in Python 3, just write:
                </p>
                <code>print("Hello World")</code>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="variable">
            <header><h1>Variable</h1></header>
            <p>
                A variable is a named location used to store data in the memory. Here's an example:
            </p>
            <code>a = 5</code>
            <p>Here, <code>a</code>  is a variable. We have assigned <code>5</code> to variable <code>a</code></p>
            <p>We do not need to define variable type in Python. You can do something like this:</p>
            <code>a = 5 <br>
                print("a =", 5) <br>
                a = "High five" <br>
                print("a =", a)
            </code>
            <p>
                Initially, integer value <code>5</code> is assigned to the variable <code>a</code>.Then, the string 
                <code>High five</code> is assigned to the same variable. 
            </p>
            <p>
                By the way,<code>5</code>  is a numeric literal and <code>"High Five"</code> is a string literal. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When you run the program, the output will be:
            </p>
            <code>
                a = 5 <br>
                a = High five
            </code>
