                    Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 
                    Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very 
                    attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to 
                    connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and 
                    therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages 
                    program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available 
                    in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
                </p>

                    Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. 
                    Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging 
                    Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, 
                    when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch 
                    the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of 
                    local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping 
                    through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, 
                    testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug 
                    a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes 
                    this simple approach very effective.

                    Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers 
                    to program without boilerplate (prepared) code. The simplest directive in Python is the "print" 
                    directive - it simply prints out a line (and also includes a newline, unlike in C).
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two major Python versions, Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2 and 3 are quite 
                    different. This tutorial uses Python 3, because it more semantically correct and supports 
                    newer features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, one difference between Python 2 and 3 is the print statement. 
                    In Python 2, the "print" statement is not a function, and therefore it is invoked without 
                    parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function, and must be invoked with parentheses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To print a string in Python 3, just write:
                </p>
                <code>print("Hello World")</code>
            </article>

            <header><h1>Variable</h1></header>
            <p>
                A variable is a named location used to store data in the memory. Here's an example:
            </p>
            <code>a = 5</code>
            <p>Here, <code>a</code>  is a variable. We have assigned <code>5</code> to variable <code>a</code></p>
            <p>We do not need to define variable type in Python. You can do something like this:</p>
            <code>a = 5 <br>
                print("a =", 5) <br>
                a = "High five" <br>
                print("a =", a)
            </code>
            <p>
                Initially, integer value <code>5</code> is assigned to the variable <code>a</code>.Then, the string 
                <code>High five</code> is assigned to the same variable. 
            </p>
            <p>
                By the way,<code>5</code>  is a numeric literal and <code>"High Five"</code> is a string literal. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When you run the program, the output will be:
            </p>
            <code>
                a = 5 <br>
                a = High five
            </code>

                    Every value in Python has a datatype. Since everything is an object in Python programming, 
                    data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are various data types in Python. Some of the important types are listed below.

                    <p>
                        Integers, floating point numbers and complex numbers fall under Python numbers category. 
                        They are defined as <code>int</code>,<code>float</code> and <code>complex</code> classes in python.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can use the <code>type()</code> function to know which class a variable or a value belongs to. Similarly, the
                        <code>isinstance()</code> function.is used to check if an object belongs to a particular class. 
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        a = 5 <br>
                        print(a, "is of type", type(a)) <br>

                            (1+2j) is complex number? True

                    <p>
                        Integers can be of any length, it is only limited by the memory available.

                    <p>
                        A floating-point number is accurate up to 15 decimal places. Integer and floating 
                        points are separated by decimal points.<code>1</code> is an integer, <code>1.0</code>
                        is a floating-point number.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Complex numbers are written in the form,<code>x + yj</code>, where <code>x</code> is the real part and 
                        <code>y</code> is the imaginary part. Here are some examples.

                    <p>
                        List is an ordered sequence of items. It is one of the most used datatype in Python 
                        and is very flexible. All the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Declaring a list is pretty straight forward. Items separated by commas are enclosed 
                        within brackets <code>[ ]</code>
                    </p>
                    <code>a = [1, 2.2, 'python']</code>
                    <p>
                        We can use the slicing operator <code>[ ]</code> to extract an item or a range of items 
                        from a list. The index starts from 0 in Python.
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        a = [5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40] <br>
                        <br>
                        # a[2] = 15 <br>
                        print("a[2] = ", a[2]) <br>
                        <br>
                        # a[0:3] = [5, 10, 15] <br>
                        print("a[0:3] = ", a[0:3]) <br>
                        <br>
                        # a[5:] = [30, 35, 40] <br>
                        print("a[5:] = ", a[5:])
                    </code>
                    <h4>Output</h4>
                    <code>
                        a[2] =  15 <br>
                        a[0:3] =  [5, 10, 15] <br>
                        a[5:] =  [30, 35, 40]
                    </code>
                    <p>Lists are mutable, meaning, the value of elements of a list can be altered.</p>
                    <code>

                        print(a)

                    <p>
                        Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as a list. The only difference is 
                        that tuples are immutable. Tuples once created cannot be modified.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tuples are used to write-protect data and are usually faster than lists as they 
                        cannot change dynamically.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is defined within parentheses <code>()</code> where items are separated by commas.</p>

                    <p>
                        We can use the slicing operator <code>[ ]</code> to extract items but we cannot change its value.
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        t = (5,'program', 1+3j) <br>

                        String is sequence of Unicode characters. We can use single quotes or double quotes to 
                        represent strings. Multi-line strings can be denoted using triple quotes, <code>'''</code>
                        or <code>"""</code>

                    Set is an unordered collection of unique items. Set is defined by values separated by comma
                    inside braces <code>{}</code>.Items in a set are not ordered.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                    We can perform set operations like union, intersection on two sets. Sets have unique values.
                     They eliminate duplicates.
                   </p>
                   <code>
                    a = {1,2,2,3,3,3} <br>
                    print(a)

                   <h4>Output</h4>
                   <code>

                    <p>
                        Since, set are unordered collection, indexing has no meaning. Hence, the slicing operator
                        <code>[]</code> does not work.

                <li><h3>Python Dictionary</h3></li>
                <p>Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.</p>
                <p>
                    It is generally used when we have a huge amount of data. Dictionaries are optimized for 
                    retrieving data. We must know the key to retrieve the value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Python, dictionaries are defined within braces <code>{}</code> with each item being a pair in the form
                    <code>key:value</code>.Key and value can be of any type.
                </p>
                <code>
                    >>> d = {1:'value','key':2} <br>
                    >>> type(d) <br>
                    &#10092;class 'dict'&#10093;
                </code>
                <p>We use key to retrieve the respective value. But not the other way around.</p>
                <code>
                    d = {1:'value','key':2} <br>
                    print(type(d)) <br>
                    <br>
                    print("d[1] = ", d[1]); <br>
                    <br>
                    print("d['key'] = ", d['key']); <br>
                    <br>
                    # Generates error <br>
                    print("d[2] = ", d[2]);

                    Decision making is required when we want to execute a code only if a certain condition is satisfied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <code>if…elif…else</code>  statement is used in Python for decision making.
                </p>
                <h4>Python if Statement Syntax</h4>
                <code>
                    if test expression: <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;statement(s)
                </code>
                <p>
                    Here, the program evaluates the <code>test expression</code> and will execute statement(s) 
                    only if the test expression is <code>True</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the test expression is <code>False</code>,the statement(s) is not executed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Python, the body of the <code>if</code> statement is indicated by the indentation. The body 
                    starts with an indentation and the first unindented line marks the end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python interprets non-zero values as <code>True</code>.<code>None</code> and <code>0</code>
                    are interpreted as <code>False</code>.
                </p>
